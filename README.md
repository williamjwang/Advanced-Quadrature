# Advanced-Quadrature

Quadrature: The process of creating a square with equal area to a particular region or figure of interest. Synonymous with numerical integration, which is concerned with estimating the area of a particular region/figure.

This project seeks to investigate/apply three advanced quadrature techniques:
- Gaussian quadrature
- Romberg integration
- Tanh-Sinh integration
